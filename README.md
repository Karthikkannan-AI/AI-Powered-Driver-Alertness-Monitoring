## Analysis of the Problem (Common Causes of Road Accidents in India) ##

1. Distracted & Drowsiness while Driving ( We will focus on this Problem)

4. Not Wearing Seat Belt
5. Rain or Wet Roads
6. Potholes and Bad Road Condition

## Solution we have Tried ##

Use Advanced facial analysis algorithms and deep learning models ( Facial Landmark Models) To Detect Distracted Driving Behaviour.
Perform real time analysis of driverâ€™s eyes, mouth, head and body movements and identify the possibility of Drowsiness ( Eye closing and Yawning)

## Evaluating the Solution ##

We have Tested in Bus, Truck, Car and Auto. As a Proof of Concept we have recorded the Driver Driving the vehicle Camera  Footage ( Day and Night Vision) and Analysed it Offline. 
We will Take this demonstration to Top Auto Manufacturers ( Car, Bus, Truck and Auto rickshaw manufacturers)  in India and explore the possibilities of Real-world Implementation

## Genuine Challenges in Implementation of Driver Activity Monitoring ##

* Driver Support ( Driver should not feel Intrusive) 
* Privacy of the Driver has to be protected 
* Who Owns this Data and how it is being used ?
* Whether these data can be used by Insurance Companies ?
