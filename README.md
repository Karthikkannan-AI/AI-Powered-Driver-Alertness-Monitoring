## Introduction  ##

Every single day there are hundreds of Road Accidents happening in India.



The Goal of the project is to use AI to Prevent Accidents and Save precious lives.



We have built and Evaluated a Driver Alertness Monitoring system proof of concept which is based on a camera to monitor driver alertness that not only recognizes the driver but also checks his or her level of alertness while driving the vehicle. 



The purpose of the Driver Monitoring System is to alert the driver when signs of drowsiness or distraction are detected. Other applications for the system are also possible, such as driver identification and control functions using the eyes. These developments will contribute to heightened safety and more intuitive use of the new generation of driver assistance functions.

## The Problem  ##

Road Accident Death ( India recorded the highest number of road accident deaths across the globe)


 ### Analysis of the Problem ###

 1. Distraction & Drowsiness while Driving ( In this project we will focus on this particular Problem) 
 2. Drunk Driving
 3. Speeding/ Reckless Driving
 4. Not Wearing Seat Belt
 5. Rain or Wet Roads
 6. Potholes and Bad Road Condition
 7. Breaking Traffic Rules
 8. Tailgating

 ### Accidents in India ( Facts and Figures) ###

 __Key Highlights__
 * A total of 449,002 accidents occurred in India in 2019.
 * 151,113 people were killed and 451,361 were injured due to road accidents. 
 * National Highways accounted for an inordinate share of deaths.

## Proposed Solution ##

Use advanced facial analysis algorithms and deep learning models ( Facial Landmark Models) to detect Distracted Driving Behaviour. Perform real-time analysis of driver’s eyes, mouth, head, and body movements and identify the possibility of Drowsiness ( Eye closing and Yawning).

### Evaluating the Solution ###

We have tested our AI-based Driver Alertness Monitoring in Bus, Truck, Car, and Auto. As a Proof of Concept, we have recorded the Driver Driving the vehicle Camera Footage ( Day and Night Vision) and analyzed it Offline. We will take this demonstration to Top Auto Manufacturers ( Car, Bus, Truck, and Auto rickshaw manufacturers) in India and explore the possibilities of Real-world Implementation.

## Genuine Challenges in Implementation of Driver Alertness Monitoring ##

* Driver Support ( Driver should not feel Intrusive as he/she is being monitored all the time ) 
* Privacy of the driver has to be protected. 
* Who owns this Driver Alertness Monitoring Data and how it is being used?
* Whether these data can be used or accessed by Insurance Companies?

## Conclusion ##

A majority of fatal accidents have been attributed
to mistakes made by drivers. This can include distraction or an unsuitable state
of mind and body (drowsiness, fatigue, intoxication, etc.).



As technologies are available to determine the
driver’s alertness while driving, Auto Manufacturers and regulators can embrace
Driver Alertness Monitoring so as to improve public safety. 



In this Proof of concept, we have showcased the
capability, further works are needed to improve the accuracy of the driver
alertness prediction algorithm.
