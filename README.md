# Evaluation of AI Powered Driver Activity Monitoring to prevent Accidents in Indian Roads #

Every Single day there are
hundreds of Road Accidents happening in India. The Goal of the Project is use
AI to Prevent Accidents and Save Precious Lives.  



We have built and Evaluated Driver
activity Monitoring system proof of concept which is based on camera to monitor
driver alertness that not only recognizes the driver, but also checks his or
her level of alertness while driving the vehicle. 



The purpose of the Driver
Monitoring system is to alert the driver when signs of drowsiness or distraction
are detected. Other applications for the system are also possible, such as
driver identification and control functions using the eyes. These developments
will contribute to heightened safety and more intuitive use of the new
generation of driver assistance functions.

## The Problem  ##

Road Accident Death ( India recorded highest number of road accident deaths across the globe)


 ### Analysis of the Problem ###

 1. Distracted & Drowsiness while Driving ( We will focus on this Problem) 
 2. Drunk Driving
 3. Speeding/ Reckless Driving
 4. Not Wearing Seat Belt
 5. Rain or Wet Roads
 6. Potholes and Bad Road Condition
 7. Breaking Traffic Rules
 8. Tailgating

 ### Accidents in India ( Facts and Figures) ###

 __Key Highlights__
 * A total of 449,002 accidents occurred in India in 2019
 * 151,113 people were killed and 451,361 were injured due to road accidents last year 
 * National Highways accounted for an inordinate share of deaths yet again

## Solution ##

Use Advanced facial analysis algorithms and deep learning models ( Facial Landmark Models) To Detect Distracted Driving Behaviour.
Perform real time analysis of driver’s eyes, mouth, head and body movements and identify the possibility of Drowsiness ( Eye closing and Yawning)

### Evaluating the Solution ###

We have Tested in Bus, Truck, Car and Auto. As a Proof of Concept we have recorded the Driver Driving the vehicle Camera  Footage ( Day and Night Vision) and Analysed it Offline. 
We will Take this demonstration to Top Auto Manufacturers ( Car, Bus, Truck and Auto rickshaw manufacturers)  in India and explore the possibilities of Real-world Implementation

## Genuine Challenges in Implementation of Driver Activity Monitoring ##

* Driver Support ( Driver should not feel Intrusive) 
* Privacy of the Driver has to be protected 
* Who Owns this Data and how it is being used ?
* Whether these data can be used by Insurance Companies ?

## Conclusion ##

A majority of fatal accidents have been attributed
to mistakes made by drivers. This can include distraction or unsuitable state
of mind and body (drowsiness, fatigue, intoxication, road rage, etc.).



As technologies are available to determine the
driver’s Activity while driving, Auto Manufacturers and regulators can embrace
Driver Activity Monitoring so as to improve public safety. 



In this Proof of concept we have showcased the
capability, further works are needed to improve the accuracy of the driver
alertness prediction algorithm.
