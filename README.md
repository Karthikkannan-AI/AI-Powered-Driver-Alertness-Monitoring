# AI-Driver-Monitoring #

With time where Ai is being an emerging technology for various solutions and problem solving cases, We have leveraged the power of AI to make solutions that are helpful in our day to day life by ensuring safety and respecting the privacy of the user of the consumer.

The following project is about ensuring the safety of the driver while driving the vehicle and alerting the driver in realtime using Artificial Intelligence

## The Problem  ##

Road Accident Death ( India recorded highest number of road accident deaths across the globe)


 ### Analysis of the Problem ###

 1. Distracted & Drowsiness while Driving ( We will focus on this Problem) 
 2. Drunk Driving
 3. Speeding/ Reckless Driving
 4. Not Wearing Seat Belt
 5. Rain or Wet Roads
 6. Potholes and Bad Road Condition
 7. Breaking Traffic Rules
 8. Tailgating

 ### Accidents in India ( Facts and Figures) ###

 __Key Highlights__
 * A total of 449,002 accidents occurred in India in 2019
 * 151,113 people were killed and 451,361 were injured due to road accidents last year 
 * National Highways accounted for an inordinate share of deaths yet again

## Solution ##

Use Advanced facial analysis algorithms and deep learning models ( Facial Landmark Models) To Detect Distracted Driving Behaviour.
Perform real time analysis of driverâ€™s eyes, mouth, head and body movements and identify the possibility of Drowsiness ( Eye closing and Yawning)

### Evaluating the Solution ###

We have Tested in Bus, Truck, Car and Auto. As a Proof of Concept we have recorded the Driver Driving the vehicle Camera  Footage ( Day and Night Vision) and Analysed it Offline. 
We will Take this demonstration to Top Auto Manufacturers ( Car, Bus, Truck and Auto rickshaw manufacturers)  in India and explore the possibilities of Real-world Implementation

## Genuine Challenges in Implementation of Driver Activity Monitoring ##

* Driver Support ( Driver should not feel Intrusive) 
* Privacy of the Driver has to be protected 
* Who Owns this Data and how it is being used ?
* Whether these data can be used by Insurance Companies ?
